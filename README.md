# MNIST Digit Classifier 🧠

A deep learning model to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## 📊 Dataset

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits:
- 60,000 for training
- 10,000 for testing  
Each image is 28x28 pixels.

## 🚀 Features

- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Achieves over 98% accuracy on test data
- Visualizes sample predictions
- Easily exportable model (`.h5` format)

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Matplotlib
